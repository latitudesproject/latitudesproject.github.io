The boat docks at Richardson Park Campground, Oregon 
1 A grandmother shepherding two children and gathering the third into her arms 
2 Flatbed pickup trucks and boats pulling into the harbor 
3 Boating safety sign - "don't go overboard with alcohol" 




On a bench overlooking the highway at a tackleshop in Springfield, OR
1 Two dogs on the floor and the sweet grainy smell of alfalfa 
2 And two iced coffees in the fridge, though this is, after all, a feed and tackle shop 
3 Which we drink on a bench outside in the heat, watching logging trucks go by 




Pulled off at the Three Sisters Overlook on the McKenzie Pass, Oregon 
1 The peak ashen and burnt and raven filled, like some ungodly place 
2 Just before hail so thick and fast it sounds symphonic 
3 I thought I'd find you here, says the man whose house we'd slept in nights before, and who pulls up in a blue coupe on the side of the trail and says, I brought you each a sandwich 




Prineville Coffee Company, Prineville, OR 
1 Do you think people die on that pass, the barista says, when a biker pulls into the drive through and tells her he is crossing the country 
2 The embarrassing joy of ice and wifi 




Pulled off on the shoulder of the Old Ochoco Highway, OR 
1 Three barbed wire fences, two downed trees, 13 mles of uphill and downhill gravel, sapling pines, one farm, and an industrial sprinkler 
2 Don't trust the alternate routes on Maps.Me 




The John Day Fossil Beds, OR 
1 Blazingly hot, despite the wind 
2 The wild exhilaration of twenty miles winding downhill 




Outside the supermarket in John Day, OR 
1 A playlist that cycles, almost inevitably, through Benny and the Jets 
2 Sitting on the pavement in the heat, tying knots in cherry stems with our tongues 




In a field in Prairie City, OR
1 Accompanied by a burly firefighter and his firefighter wife - we met in Minnesota, they say, and we return sometimes on fire details 
2 Though he tells us this while holding up a speaker in one hand and binoculars in the other 
3 That's a bobolink, he says. A bobolink! 
4 Later we will stop by a neighbor's house to tell them about the bobolink. Is that a rare thing, says the friend. 




At the Inland Cafe in Baker City, Oregon 
1 In a cafe next to a grandfather telling his grandson, you'll never grow if you don't eat more toast.

2 A man lying facedown in the back of his pickup truck, a towel over his head, blasting - Lady Gaga, Adele, and Let the Bodies Hit the Floor 
3 The next day he will introduce himself to us as Rick. It's my birthday he says. Good day to fish for crappies. 




On the front porch of Liâ€™s Chinese restaurant in Council, Idaho 
1 When we walk in the chef, a man with a buzz cut and a torn plastic camo jacket, runs to the back and turns on a multicolored boombox and begins dancing wildly, Gangnam style 
2 There is no menu, he says. The menu is in his head. 
3 We toast each other with slices of watermelon that arrive inexplicably and he says, my children have gone home to Shanghai, it is hard to own a restaurant here, I have not heard anyone speak Chinese for years 




On the back of a truck headed to Riggins, Idaho 
1 I worry about you kids, says the old man who approaches us outside of a cafe where we have only ordered chicken soup and coffee. The canyon pass gets nasty and narrow. 
2 You'll have to ride in the back, he says, if that's ok. Too much stuff in the front. 
3 But the lady can sit on the ice chest if its more comfortable.

On a pull off on the way up to White Bird Hill, Idaho

In the campground of Lost Trail Hot Springs
1 A man with LIFE tattooed on our knuckles who waves us over to his campground 
2 This isn't fancy food, he says, but by then we are already eating whole spoonfuls of potato salad at one go 
3 Jesus, says the grandfather. I don't even like walking more than 500 feet at a time. I have a four wheeler for that.

45° 19' 23.6532'' N112° 6' 25.002'' W

Outside a gas station in Alder, Montana
1 A spotted dog loping back and forth on the highway. 
2 So, we say, as we bike through the pouring rain. The darkened sky wasn't due to forest fires. 


44° 50' 50.3808'' N111° 31' 57.8028'' W

At the free showers in the Driftwater resort
1 This is Chewy, says the woman at the office, gesturing at the chihuahua.

44° 16' 3.2736'' N110° 38' 13.6716'' W

At the edge of Yellowstone
1 So many cars pulled off to the road we assume there must be a bison. 
2 Though it is only the view, a lake so spectacular we cannot stop saying wow. 


43° 49' 27.2856'' N110° 21' 20.4696'' W

At a campfire just beyond the Grand Tetons
1 Kindling that catches so fast we start eyeing the Smoky the Bear signs nervously. 
2 And by seven pm we are hiding in our tent, under siege from mosquitos. 
3 It'll be better in Dubois, we say questioningly, and a man in an RV next door says, I don't know about that.

In the kitchen, baking apple turnovers in Lander, WY

Playing ping pong in an empty church basement in Jeffrey City, WY
1 The night before our hosts say, you know that phrase, boom and bust? Because you're headed to a bust town. 
2 People literally put their homes on the back of a truck and drove them away.' 
3 But the church hosts cyclists, and when we arrive the walls are a kind of a guestbook, signed by travelers from South Korea and France and Holland, and several that have inexplicably ridden through twice in two summers.

In a Thai restaurant in Rawlins, WY
1 We learn there is a Thai restaurant two days before and pant our way up whole mountains saying, think of pad thai.

Outside a Walmart in Rawlins, WY
1 A man in a ripped T-shirt says, I like what you're doing, camping in the Walmart, if the cops come, just holler. 
2 You can ride the trains anywhere, he says. I came from Kodiak, Alaska, and my buddy and I are headed to Maine. 
3 Thanks, we say, but they said we could camp here. The next morning a man in sunglasses says, this is not a campground. It's a Walmart. And we say, we did call, but also, that is a good point. 


41° 12' 21.8556'' N106° 48' 0.504'' W

In a campsite in Encampment, WY
1 A mile down the road from Riverside, population 52 
2 Truth be told, says our bartender, I don't remember how to make a whiskey sour. 
3 Though he turns out to be a former archaeologist. There are spears, he says, that can pierce clear through a buffalo.

Outside a combination general store and family home at the base of the Rockies
1 I'm sorry, says the woman who comes to the front, her kids streaking in bathing suits behind the counter. I was trying to take in some laundry before it rained. 
2 Eating ice cream cones on the porch and watching hummingbirds swarm the feeders, dozens at a time 
3 You know, I say. I've never been in a place where you could adequately refer to hummingbirds as an infestation

In an Ethiopian restaurant in Fort Collins, CO
1 Eating injera with our hands and fast enough that we feel like animals

3 It must be nice, in the mountains, talking to yourself - and she makes a gesture around her face, like a circle, and says - being alone with your thoughts 


39° 44' 21.57'' N104° 59' 5.3052'' W

Aboard a bus in Denver, CO
1 A festival going on just outside the window

In the rain beneath the awning of a Chinese buffet in Sterling, CO

2 Listening to tinny iPhone music as couples carrying takeout boxes dash into their cars 
3 Maybe the storm will wane soon, says Max, the rain fountaining off of the awning
